- The provided implementation uses <b>Connected Architecture</b> of ADO.NET. Hereâ€™s why:

# In the given implementation, Connected Architecture is a better choice because:

1. It aligns well with the generic repository pattern.
2. Each operation (CRUD) executes a single command or query.
3. It avoids unnecessary overhead of managing disconnected data structures.

# Characteristics of Connected Architecture in the Code

## 1. Direct Database Connection

- The code explicitly opens a database connection using SqliteConnection (e.g., connection.OpenAsync()).
- It keeps the connection open while executing SQL commands and fetching data.

## 2. Immediate Execution

- SQL queries are executed immediately through commands like ExecuteReaderAsync, ExecuteNonQueryAsync, etc.
- Data is processed directly from the SqliteDataReader in memory without intermediate storage (e.g., a DataSet or DataTable).

## 3. No Disconnected Data Structures

- The code does not use ADO.NET objects like DataSet or DataAdapter for disconnected operations.
- It retrieves and processes data sequentially and releases the connection once the task is done.

## 4. Optimized for Real-Time Operations

- This approach is suitable for scenarios where data is fetched, modified, or written immediately.
